        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
          DASL ("dazzle") is a small set of simple, standard primitives for working with content-addressed,
          linked data. It builds on content addressing, a proven approach used in Git and
          <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/what-is-ipfs/">IPFS</a> to
          create reliable content identifiers (known as CIDs) through cryptographic hashing. Content addressing
          enables robust data integrity checks and efficient networking: systems can verify they received exactly
          what they asked for and avoid downloading the same content twice. The linked data part lets you link to
          stuff by its hash. You can build very big graphs with these primitives, such as the graph behind Bluesky.
        </p>
        <p>
          We call DASL "data-addressed" because it supports a data serialization component that makes
          <a href="https://proto.school/content-addressing">content-addressing</a> sweet and easy when
          working with data. The design is inspired by subcomponents of the
          <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS</a> universe, but simplified to improve
          interoperability, decrease costs, and work well with the web. More specifically, our priorities are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>pave the cowpaths</strong>: we focus on supporting what people trying to solve real-world
            problems actually use. This takes over any consideration of engineering ideals or theoretical purity.
            We're retconning the spec to what people actually use implement — as it should be.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>extensibility vs optionality</strong>: extensibility is important for long-lived distributed
            systems, because the world will happen and you will need to change. But introducing optionality
            reduces interoperability and increases cost of both implementation and adoption. So rather than
            require support for many options now, we have extension points now but deliberately don't use their
            full range.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>don't make me think</strong>: you don't want to be thinking about content addressing. You
            want to grab this off the shelf and have something that works out of the box. Nothing weird, no
            impedance mismatch with the systems you know and love (or maybe know and hate, but whatever, it
            just works).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>lightweight loading</strong>: some people like JavaScript, others don't. We don't care, we
            just want things that work. What's certain is that you can't ignore it and be relevant. The ability
            to ship small code to the browser is critical.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unix philosophy</strong>: all of our specs are tiny and meant to compose together in simple
            ways that can be implemented independently from one another.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is intended to work for the community, to grow support for what we need. If you have thoughts, don't
          be shy and <a href="https://github.com/darobin/dasl.ing/issues">submit an issue</a>! No stupid questions,
          don't assume everyone else has context that you don't. If this page isn't enough to understand DASL,
          then we're the ones who screwed up.

        <h2>How</h2>

          This section describes how to use DASL patterns. It's work in progress!

        <h2>Implementations</h2>
        <p>
          DASL is a strict subset of IPFS CIDs and IPLD, so existing IPFS and IPLD implementations will just
          read DASL CIDs and dCBOR42 without so much as a hiccup. Some implementations also specifically target a DASL subset.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some implementations that partially or fully support DASL:</p>

          </dt>
          <dd>
            CIDs (Content IDs) are identifiers used for addressing resources by their contents, essentially a hash
            with limited metadata.
          </dd>

          </dt>
          <dd>
            dCBOR42 is a serialization format that is deterministic (so that the same data will have the same CID)
            and that features native support for using CIDs as links.

            <a href="car.html">Content-Addressable aRchives (CAR)</a>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The CAR format offers a serialized representation of set of content-addressed
            resources in one single concatenated stream, alongside a header that describes
            that content.

          </dt>
          <dd>
            MASL is a CBOR-based metadata system that is designed to work well with content-addressed
            and decentralised systems, to enable fully self-contained, self-certified content
            distribution.

          </dt>
          <dd>
            RASL is a URL scheme used to identify content-addressed DASL resources
            along with a simple HTTP-based retrieval method.

            <a href="bdasl.html">Big DASL (BDASL)</a>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            This extends DASL CIDs with a new hash type that works better for large files but isn't
            available by default in browsers, and therefore not an appropriate option in most
            situations.

          </dt>
          <dd>
            DASL components are designed to be small and to the extent possible self-contained.
            Because of that, despite having roots in IPFS, no DASL component depends on
            traditional IPFS implementations. In many cases, systems produced to work with
            DASL will interoperate with IPFS, but DASL's independence means that there can
            occasionally be impedance mismatch. This document is a non-normative list of
            things to consider when using DASL with IPFS systems, particularly with ones based
            on the DHT and Bitswap.
