      <p>
        <strong>Digital technology is infrastructure</strong>. It’s a critical input to our businesses, essential to the
        operation of our governments, everywhere in the lives of our citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Infrastructure is powerful</strong>. It shapes what runs on it and sets the rules that govern its users.
        Infrastructural power is even stronger when the infrastructure is programmable such that it can
        adapt the way in which it directs those who depend on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Authoritarian infrastructure leads to an authoritarian society</strong>. A tiny group of people has a
        near-unilateral say over the information we access, our communication channels, the taxes they
        levy on digital businesses, the rules of online commerce, the livelihood of our media, the
        labour conditions of millions, the operation of almost all critical internet services. The
        laws they set have a footprint that competes directly with those of the state.
      </p>
      <p>
        This fast-growing encroachment on our sovereignty has created a doom loop in which authoritarian
        digital infrastructure undermines democracy, and weaker democracy is then incapable of containing
        the expansion of authoritarian infrastructure. Fixated on the myth that tech monopolies were built
        with innovation and can therefore be broken by innovation, our leaders have consistently missed the
        fact that what the monopolies do isn’t innovate but rather capture key control points in the
        architecture of digital systems. Tech sovereignty cannot come from innovation policy alone — it requires
        liberating our infrastructure from foreign, increasingly hostile control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over centuries, we have learnt to govern traditional infrastructure piece by piece so that it would
        serve us rather than the other way around. We have established models to operate infrastructure in
        the public interest, supporting businesses in focusing on their core competences and citizens in
        their ability to be and to do more.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the sudden arrival of so many new infrastructural systems with the stunning growth of the
        digital sphere has created an infrastructure shock. If we care about democracy, we have to
        shock it back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our strategy to restore democratic power to the digital sphere and reverse the doom loop is
        threefold:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We will <strong>bolster</strong> institutional capacity across society so that digital infrastructures are
          governed by their stakeholders.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will <strong>break</strong> the authoritarian control over tech by relentlessly going after their large-scale illegal
          behaviour and dismantling their abusive concentration of power.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will <strong>build</strong> infrastructure designed to support prosperity, resilience, and democracy
          through an ambitious deployment of tech, governance, and funding bringing together
          actors from government, the private sector, and the commons.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is a daunting project but we have the technology, the people, and the know-how. We are
        experienced and pragmatic: we know that the result will be imperfect and have to be continuously
        refined. But we will take imperfect freedom over begging monopolies for crumbs. We will take the
        messy resilience of a creative society over Silicon Valley’s brittle and bland slop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Democracy is daunting too, as well as imperfect — and there is no better way to be. Democracy is the
        future of technology. It’s time for this broad alliance to join forces across our society and to
        install every part of democracy deep into our digital sphere.
